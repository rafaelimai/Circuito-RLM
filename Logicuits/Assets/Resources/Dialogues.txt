Welcome, Test Subject.
I am Manjubator5000. I will aid you during your tests.
The challenges ahead of you will test your thinking, willpower, and ultimately, your ability to build logic circuits.
Do you see the Task tables on the lower right? That's your SPECIFICATION. I said it in CAPS because it's IMPORTANT.
Every line of the tables represents a TEST. Your circuit must pass all tests to be accepted.
The Input table indicates the logic values that will be provided on the inputs, the yellow arrows on the left.
The Expected table indicates the logic values expected on the outputs, the yellow arrows on the right.
The Output table is what your circuit is actually bringing to the outputs.
Your job is to make the Expected and Output tables IDENTICAL. EVERY LINE. Don't insist. Seriously.
Begin by connecting the input, on the left of the screen, to the output, on the right.
Then press "Check" to see your circuit in action.

Congratulations. You managed to complete the simplest task possible. Are you proud of yourself?
The next challenge will require you to use a new tool.
Do you see the Toolbox on the upper left corner? It displays the tools available to you.
It currently contains an INVERTER, or NOT gate. It outputs the oposite of its input. Simple as that.

Next up you'll be using an OR gate. It basically adds up two signals.
So if either input is a 1, the output will be 1.
OR gates are great when you need MORE 1's in your signal. Keep that in mind.
